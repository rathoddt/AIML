Getting Started with BigQuery ML  
BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratise machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

```
#Task 2. Create a model
#standardSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
LIMIT 100000;
```

## Task 3. Evaluate the model
```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ml.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'));
```
If used with a linear regression model, the above query returns the following columns:

mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, mean_squared_log_error,
median_absolute_error, r2_score, explained_variance.
If used with a logistic regression model, the above query returns the following columns:

precision, recall
accuracy, f1_score
log_loss, roc_auc


## Task 4. Use the model
Predict purchases per country  
With this query you will try to predict the number of transactions made by visitors of each country, sort the results, and select the top 10 countries by purchases:
```
#standardSQL
SELECT
  country,
  SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
FROM
  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
SELECT
  IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
  device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
  IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
  IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
